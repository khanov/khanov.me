The company I currently work for was kind enough to support me and send to Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference. Because there is a huge demand every year to attend WWDC and not everybody is able to go, in this article, I am going to share my experience and some thoughts along the way. Hopefully, it will be useful and give you a good idea of what to expect from the conference, especially if you've never been to WWDC before.

As you probably know, this year Apple did a lottery — you've got to have luck on your side to be randomly selected by Apple to attend the conference. I didn't win in the lottery but my coworker did and he kindly transferred his ticket to me (you can transfer tickets only within your company team members). That's how I got into The Party (there are many other parties during the week — more on that later).

## People

WWDC is amazing. I mean when will you have the chance to meet so many great people from all over the world in one place again who are, just like you, so passionate about making iOS and Mac apps? 

Yes, going to the sessions is important, but you can always watch them later online. I think talking to fellow developers and Apple engineers face to face is more valuable and you _should_ try to meet as many interesting people as possible at WWDC. 

The person next to you in line might be working on an app you use everyday. Don't be shy to say hi. Show them that cool feature in your app you worked on last month. Even if you're just starting out with app development, you probably have a couple of interesting ideas that are worth talking about. It's amazing how curious and excited people get when discussing stuff that they really passionate about. I love it.

That's how I met someone from Atlassian (they develop my favorite visual git client — SourceTree), Justin Youens (developer of Launch Center Pro), Jim Dalrymple (The Loop), Genady Okrain (creator of the WWDC Parties app), several Russian-speaking iOS developers at Yandex and Parallels, and the list goes on and on. I have been following most of these people on Twitter for a long time and finally meeting them in real life was exciting and fun.

## Keynote Day

I woke up at 2-something in the morning and got to Moscone West at around 4 AM. Six hours before the keynote, the line had already turned the corner! At that moment, I truly realized how huge it's going to be. It felt like excitement was in the air.

Next time (I hope I'll have a chance to attend WWDC again), I'm going to line up at midnight. I know how crazy and ridiculous it may sound, but I'm one of those crazy devs who want to have this experience at least once in their lives.

The keynote itself made developers feel that they are the special ones. They showed how mobile developers change the world. It was very inspiring. There is no question it's a great time to be an iOS or Mac developer.

You all know that Apple has always been known for doing great keynotes. Since I started following Apple about five years ago, I wanted to meet Steve Jobs in real life one day. Unfortunately, that dream has never come true and never will. So I wondered how this year's WWDC keynote will be like. Craig Federighi ran most of the show and I loved it. The jokes, the style, everything was a pleasure to watch.

## Parties

Speaking of parties, WWDC is not the only party that happens during the week. Many companies organize their own parties throughout the week, so their team and fellow developers can hang out together and exchange knowledge and interesting ideas. Usually, there is free soda/beer & pizza and someone is giving a talk.

For most parties, you need to RSVP to be able to attend them. The demand is very high, so you'd better do that in advance. I was lucky to get into cool parties such as: 

* **Crashlytics + Twitter WWDC Party**: this one was the "partiest" one, felt like a real party where everybody got drunk. I had my [Lapka Breath Alcohol Monitor](https://mylapka.com/bam) with myself, so this party was the perfect place to show it off.

* **Firebase + Pebble WWDC Happy Hour**: there were shown cool Pebble projects from hackatons. I got so inspired to make my own app that I actually [went to an AT&T store to buy a Pebble smartwatch](https://twitter.com/khanov/status/475393810756030464).

* **The CocoaPods Alt State of the Union**: as they said, "We have nothing to announce", but it was lots of fun anyway!

* **Dropbox Mixer**: at this party, I got into a long conversation with a Dropbox engineer who programmed in C. It was cool to get some insight how Dropbox makes apps.

* **Pilgrimage 2014**: this was a bus tour to Cupertino, CA with fellow Apple peeps.  I can now proudly say "I visited the Mothership".

## Bonus

So, that's how I got a chance to attend Apple's 25th annual conference for developers. Here's a little video of WWDC moments I had time to record.

Hoping to go next year as well. Wish me luck!
